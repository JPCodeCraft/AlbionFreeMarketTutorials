# **The Depths Guide - Your Gateway to PvP**

## **Introduction**

The Depths dropped in June 2025 and completely changed how new players learn PvP in Albion Online. Think of it as PvP with training wheels - you keep your gear when you die, but lose whatever's in your bag. Pretty smart, right?

This extraction-style dungeon has already seen over 4 million runs in just a few weeks. Why? Because it finally solves that age-old problem: how do you learn PvP without going broke?

## **What Makes The Depths Different**

The Depths use something called **"Orange PvP"** - a totally new ruleset that sits between Yellow and Red zones:

- ‚úÖ **Your equipped gear stays safe** (weapons, armor, accessories)
- ‚ùå **Everything in your inventory drops** (loot, consumables, gathered items)
- üíÄ **You can be revived by teammates** or choose to bail and drop a soul

It's basically the perfect place to test that expensive build you've been eyeing without risking millions in silver.

## **How to Enter The Depths**

Finding and entering The Depths is straightforward once you know what to look for:

### **Level Breakdown**

**Level 1 - The Warmup**

- Easy mobs, basic loot
- Good for learning the mechanics
- Low PvP risk (most teams are just starting)

**Level 2 - Decision Time**

- Harder mobs, better rewards
- This is where you decide: cash out or go deeper?
- Higher chance of PvP encounters

**Level 3 - The Treasure Vault**

- Hardest mobs, best buffs
- Ends with a locked vault that opens for 60 seconds
- Pure chaos when multiple teams fight over the vault
- Dungeon collapses after vault timer - escape or die!

## **Understanding Souls**

The Soul system is unique to The Depths and adds a whole new layer of strategy:

<img src="https://cdn.albionfreemarket.com/AlbionFreeMarketTutorials/tutorials/depths/image4.png" alt="soul types" width="900" height="400">

| **Soul Type** | **Color** | **Source**              | **Value** | **Strategy**                        |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Hostile**   | Red       | Enemy players           | Highest   | Priority target for altar offerings |
| **Friendly**  | Blue      | Allied players          | Medium    | Revive allies when possible         |
| **Neutral**   | White     | Mobs & players who left | Low       | Grab if nothing else available      |

### **What Happens When You Die**

When you get knocked down, you have two choices:

1. **Wait for revival** - Keep your gear, hope your team wins
2. **Leave The Depths** - Drop a neutral soul, keep your gear, lose everything else

## **Best Team Compositions**
