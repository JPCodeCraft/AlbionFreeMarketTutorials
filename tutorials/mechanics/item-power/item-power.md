# Understanding Item Power in Albion Online

Ever wondered why some players seem significantly stronger than others despite wearing similar gear? The answer likely lies in Item Power (IP), one of Albion Online's most important mechanics. In this guide, we'll talk about Item Power and how it affects your character's performance.

## What is Item Power?

At its core, Item Power is a numerical value that represents the overall strength of your equipment. Think of it as a power rating that increases the base attributes of your items and their associated skills. The higher your IP, the more powerful your character becomes – but there's more to it than just a simple number.

## How Item Power Affects Your Gameplay

Item Power's influence on your gameplay is both straightforward and nuanced. Here's what you need to know:

- **Stat Scaling**: Higher IP directly increases most of your equipment's base stats. Your armor becomes more protective, your weapons deal more damage, and your accessories provide stronger bonuses.

- **Skill Enhancement**: The abilities on your equipment become more potent with increased IP. For example, a healing spell will restore more health, and a damage ability will hit harder.

- **Quality Matters**: The quality of your item, from Normal to Masterpiece, can add up to 100 IP to your gear. This makes seeking high-quality items a worthwhile investment for serious players.

## The Pillars of Item Power

Your gear's Item Power is determined by four key factors:

1. **Tier**: Starting from Tier 4, each tier increases your base IP by 100 points. This makes progression through tiers a crucial part of character development.

2. **Enchantments**: Those mysterious .1, .2, .3, and .4 numbers you see? They represent enchantment levels, each adding 100 IP to your item.

3. **Quality**: From Normal to Masterpiece, better quality means higher IP. A Masterpiece item can have up to 100 more IP than its Normal counterpart.

   - **Normal**: 0 IP
   - **Good**: +20 IP
   - **Outstanding**: +40 IP
   - **Excellent**: +60 IP
   - **Masterpiece**: +100 IP

4. **Type**: Different item types (Normal, Artifact, Royal, etc.) have varying base IP values, adding another layer of customization to your build.

5. **Mastery Modifier**: Mastery Modifier is an attribute found on combat-related items starting from Tier 5, increasing in increments of 5% per tier. This attribute enhances the additional Item Power gained from your Mastery and Specialization levels, effectively amplifying the bonuses from these skill nodes. It multiplies the Item Power bonuses provided by your respective Mastery node and related Specialization nodes. It does not affect the base Item Power of the item itself. This system incentivizes players to use higher-tier weapons and armor as they advance in Mastery and Specialization, maximizing the benefits of the Mastery Modifier.

- **Tier Scaling of Mastery Modifier**:

  | Tier | Mastery Modifier |
  | ---- | ---------------- |
  | 5    | 5%               |
  | 6    | 10%              |
  | 7    | 15%              |
  | 8    | 20%              |

## Average Item Power

Item Power (IP) of your equipment is used to calculate the average IP, providing an overview of your overall gear strength. The average IP is determined by summing the IP of all relevant gear pieces and dividing by the number of applicable slots. Note that certain slots, such as the satchel, are excluded from this calculation. While increasing the average IP can enhance your character's performance, focusing on boosting the IP of specific gear pieces can yield more significant benefits in combat.

## Determining Item Power

The base Item Power of any gear piece is influenced by four primary factors: Tier, Type, Enchantment, and Quality. Starting from Tier 4, each subsequent tier adds 100 IP to the base value. The type of gear, whether Normal, Artifact, Royal, Misty, or Avalonian, affects the base IP, with higher types providing additional IP increments. Enchantments further increase IP by 100 per enchantment level (.1 to .4). Additionally, the quality of an item, ranging from Normal to Masterpiece, can contribute up to 100 IP, enhancing the overall strength of the gear.

## Scaling Mechanics

Item Power scales the base attributes and skill strengths of your equipment. Flat attribute bonuses and specific skill effects increase proportionally with higher IP, enhancing the effectiveness of your gear. However, percentage-based attributes typically do not scale with IP, maintaining consistent values regardless of IP levels. Understanding which attributes scale and which remain constant is essential for optimizing your build and making informed decisions about gear enhancements.

## Important Things to Remember

Not everything scales with Item Power in the same way. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

- **Mount Speeds**: While mounts have IP, their movement speed bonuses don't scale with it. A T5 horse won't run faster just because it has higher IP.

- **Percentage-Based Effects**: Most percentage-based bonuses don't increase with IP. This creates interesting build considerations where sometimes a lower-tier item might be preferable for certain effects.

- **Zone Restrictions**: Some areas in Albion have IP caps, meaning your effective IP might be lowered to match the zone's restrictions. This creates a more level playing field in certain content.

## Maximizing Your Item Power

Want to make the most of the IP system? Here are some tips:

- Focus on specializing in specific weapon and armor types rather than spreading yourself thin
- Invest in higher quality gear when possible, as the IP bonus can be substantial
- Consider enchanted gear for the significant IP boost it provides
- Remember that higher IP doesn't always mean better performance – understanding how your skills and build work together is crucial

## Conclusion

Item Power is more than just a number – it's a fundamental system that affects nearly every aspect of combat and progression in Albion Online. Understanding how IP works and scales lets you make better decisions about your gear and character development, ultimately making you a more effective player.
