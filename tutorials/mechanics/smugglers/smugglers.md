# The Smuggler's Dens and the Smuggler's Network

## Smuggler’s Dens

Smuggler’s Dens are bases in Albion’s tough regions. Located in the Outlands, they offer Bank, Market (Smuggler's Network), Repair Station, Artifact Foundry, Faction Representative and Travel Planner.

For solo players, these dens provide safety and travel options deep in Albion. The player can set the Den as his base.

The first time the player enters a Den, he completes a Journal mission.

## Smuggler’s Network

The Smuggler’s Network is a system of interconnected marketplaces in the Outlands, managed by the Smuggler Faction. Each Smuggler’s Den has a market from this network, allowing players to trade items across the Outlands, separate from the Royal Continent's markets.

The Network effectively connects the markets of all 35 Smuggler's Dens and the 3 Rests. This "free transport" is balanced by a fee that increases with the distance between where the market order was placed and where it is fulfilled. The fee applies to both buying and selling operations.

The fee is calculated at 4% per map distance. For example, if an order is placed 3 maps away, the fee will be 12% of the item's base price (before market taxes and setup fees).

Therefore, trading costs vary based on the distance items travel. Players must decide whether to buy nearby, travel to distant dens for better deals, or return to the Royal Continent to save Silver.

The markets have an option to display prices with or without the travel fee.
