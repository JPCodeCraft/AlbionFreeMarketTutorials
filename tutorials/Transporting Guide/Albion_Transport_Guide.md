# How to Transport in Albion

🚚 **Transporting** is a crucial part of Albion's economy because of the different local bonuses and resource distribution. Prices tend to vary across royal cities.

The most significant and noticeable price changes occur in **Caerleon**. This is due to two factors:

1. **Surrounding Red Zones**: Caerleon is surrounded by red zones, which means that every transport carries the risk of 💀 death.
2. **The Black Market**: Caerleon hosts a unique feature called the "Black Market."



## 🛒 What is the Black Market?

In Albion, every item dropped by a player must be crafted. The Black Market is the game's mechanism to introduce player-created items into the loot pool. It also regulates the number of items in the game. 

💡 **Tip**: The Black Market allows you to sell large quantities of items, often at better prices than the normal market offers. This is one of the reasons why prices in Caerleon are higher.



## 🚴‍♂️ How to Transport?

When transporting around royal cities, you don't need to overthink it. To maximize time efficiency, choose the right mount:

| ⚖️ **Transport Weight** | 🐾 **Recommended Mount**   | 💬 **Notes**          |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Light            | Wolf               | Speed-focused        |
| Medium           | Moose, Boar        | Balanced capacity    |
| Heavy            | Bear, Ox           | Maximum capacity     |

- **Light Transport**: Invest in a better bag, 🥧 pork pie, and use a fast mount like a wolf.
- **Medium Transport**: Use a peak moose or boar.
- **Heavy Transport**: Choose a bear or ox.

🔍 **Note**: Shoes can also increase your carry weight (more IP means more carry weight). 



### 🌀 Using Avalonian Roads

To speed up transportation between royal cities, especially if the distance is more than one city, you can use Avalonian roads. Here's how:

- 🔍 Check every Avalonian road near the city and pick the most suitable one.
- Avalonian roads are **black zones**, so they carry the risk of 💀 dying, although the risk is relatively low.
- When you enter from a yellow/blue zone, you'll almost always find yellow/blue zone maps within it.

⚠️ Warning: Always be cautious of potential threats when traveling in Avalonian roads.



## 🛡️ How to Transport Safely to Caerleon?

First, understand that there is no 100% safe way to transport to Caerleon. Although you can do it through normal maps, I advise against it. Red zones have many scouts, making the risk of dying much higher than in Avalonian roads.

To find a good Avalonian road:

1. 🐴 Take a horse from Caerleon and go to an Avalonian road located no more than one map away from the city.
2. 🗺️ If the Avalonian road is slightly farther from the city gate, and you see a good red zone map close to the city within that Avalonian road, this is your ideal scenario.
3. 🌟 Sometimes, going one Avalonian road deeper can lead to yellow/blue zones, which are even better.
4. ⏳ It's always better to take a longer trip than to die and lose all your stuff.

🚫 Avoid: Avalonian roads with heavy traffic or scouts inside.



### ⚔️ Builds

#### 🚀 Fast Mount Build Example

Below is an example set for any fast mount—in this scenario, a **husky**. 

![build1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSTIIIhg/AlbionFreeMarketTutorials/refs/heads/main/tutorials/Transporting%20Guide/Screenshot%202024-12-30%20205523.png)

- Why Husky? 🐕‍🦺 It has the best ability out of all fast mounts. You can negate the downside of its ability by dismounting for half a second and then mounting again.
- Boots: Miner boots, or if you don't have them unlocked, soldier boots. These provide the most distance.
- Chest: Armor of Valor or Assassin Jacket. Assassin Jacket offers a good ability, but most ganking teams have invisibility cancellation tools like sticky potions or Stalker Hoods. Therefore, Armor of Valor is often a safer choice. Remember that every armor ability puts the player in combat.
- Weapon: Bloodletter for its second W ability and E ability. 
  - Why Bloodletter over Carving with Last W? Bloodletter's mobility ensures that gankers cannot purge your boots in the last seconds of your W, providing enough distance to escape.
- Off-hand: Mistcaller for extra mobility.
- Helmet: Soldier Helmet for additional crowd-control resistance.
- Cape: Fort Sterling Cape. The one-time CC cleanse may save you while using a fast mount.
- **Potion**: Invisible Potion or Gigantify Potion. The latter provides extra survivability.

#### 🐻 Transport Mount Build Example

Below is an example set for any transport mount—in this scenario, an **elite bear**.

![build2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSTIIIhg/AlbionFreeMarketTutorials/refs/heads/main/tutorials/Transporting%20Guide/Screenshot%202024-12-30%20203700.png)

- Mount: Elite Bear or Elite Bighorn Ram.
  - **Why Bighorn Ram?** 🐏 Its ability is very good and overall gives a higher chance of escaping, at the cost of HP and carry weight.
- Boots: Miner boots. For transport mounts, you can't use soldier boots because you won't have enough time for their ability to activate.
- Chest: Always use armor, preferably Armor of Valor, because it offers the most defense and gives an extra 100 IP due to being an Avalonian artifact.
- Weapon: Bloodletter for the same reason as for the fast mount. However, you can also use any sword.
- Off-hand: Astral Aegis for extra tankiness.
- Helmet: Miner Cap for CC cleanse.
- Cape: Bracillien Cape.
  - Why not Fort Sterling Cape? For heavy mounts like a bear, one cleansed CC isn't worth it. Bracillien Cape grants purge immunity.
- Potion: Always use Gigantify Potion. Without it, you won't be able to move after being dismounted. However, its effect lasts only 6 seconds, so if you're not close enough to the gate, you probably won't survive.



### ⚙️ Faction Warfare

Faction warfare is an event that occurs several times a day. During this time, every red zone outpost turns into a Caerleon outpost, and large groups of faction-flagged players fight for these zones. How can you take advantage of this?

These groups of players can act as unpaid escorts that make trips to Caerleon every few hours. To get notifications, simply join any faction of a royal city (you don't need to be faction-flagged). This way, you'll get notifications when the bandit assault starts.

Next, go to the yellow zone near the city and find a forming group of players, or wait in the yellow zone near the red zone heading towards Caerleon. Even if something happens to your escort (which is unlikely), you will probably find a group of transporters who also use the bandit assault as an escort. This greatly reduces the chance that you'll be the one ganked among 30+ people.



### 🌫️ Mists as a Way to Escape

The Mists can save you in many situations. How do you use the Mists to your advantage?

Mists are commonly found in the open world, and they can save your life if you manage to enter one. However, it isn't easy because Mists require some roaming before they open. If you start roaming around a non-open Mist, most gankers will dismount. If they don't, you have a free escape. 

If you begin entering the Mist before the enemy dismounts, they won't be able to attack you before you enter. So, if you see an open Mist on your way, always go for it. 

⚠️ **Be Aware**: Some mount abilities can interrupt your channeling, such as the crow.

### 🧠 Tips

- 🚨 If you enter a zone and instantly see a group of players, **do not panic**. Wait a bit before going back or even go slightly deeper into the zone. 
  - **Why?** You can't instantly switch zones. If they see you trying to leave, some will immediately follow you to the next zone. Waiting or moving deeper can buy you time or bait them entirely.(Video below)
- 🔀 If you see a scout at the entrance of the map, try to take a less obvious route. Solo gankers using their phones to scout tend to stay at the most obvious paths. Keep this in mind for safer travel.
