# HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO ALBION FREE MARKET VIA ALLSHOP

- Use this guide when you cannot complete a Stripe or Patreon subscription on the [Albion Free Market support page](https://albionfreemarket.com/support-us).

## WHY CHOOSE ALLSHOP?

- [AllShop](https://www.allshop.gg/) is a third-party marketplace that accepts additional payment methods (including PayPal and regional options) that Stripe may not cover.
- AFM treats AllShop purchases as **manual** subscriptions. Once your order is verified, time is added to your account by hand, so expect a small delay.
- As noted on [Support Us](https://albionfreemarket.com/support-us), AllShop is a fallback, not the preferred checkout. Use Stripe or Patreon whenever possible for instant activation and automated renewals.

## PREP BEFORE YOU BUY

- **Check the Terms**: Re-read the AFM [Terms of Service](https://albionfreemarket.com/tos) and be sure you agree before purchasing.
- **Have contact channels ready**: AFM handles manual activations through the third party chat (All Shop) chat features. In case you need it, you can also reach us via [Feedback Page](https://albionfreemarket.com/feedback) or Discord.
- **Create (or sign in to) your AllShop profile**: Account creation is free and required to purchase.

## STEP-BY-STEP: BUYING TIME ON ALLSHOP

1. **Open the AFM offers page**
   - Go directly to the Albion Free Market store on AllShop: [https://www.allshop.gg/seller/Albion%20Free%20Market/?page=offers](https://www.allshop.gg/seller/Albion%20Free%20Market/?page=offers).
   - Verify the storefront badge and that the seller name is exactly _Albion Free Market_ before proceeding.
2. **Pick the package you need**
   - Offers usually mirror Stripe plans (e.g., monthly Masterpiece access or multi-month bundles). Read the duration description carefully because refunds are **not** available.
   - Click the offer card to open the product page, then choose `Add to cart` or `Buy now`.
3. **Review payment options**
   - AllShop supports multiple processors; select the one that works in your region.
   - Double-check currency conversions or processing fees before you confirm.
4. **Submit the order**
   - Provide the same email you use on Albion Free Market so staff can locate your account.
   - Finish the payment flow and wait for the AllShop confirmation screen.

## CONFIRM YOUR ACCESS WITH AFM

- Once payment clears, AFM needs to manually add time to your account.
  - Let us know your email (the one you use in Albion Free Market) and the plan you purchased.
- AFM will reply when the subscription time is attached to your account. Processing is typically quick but can take up to 24 hours depending on availability.
- After activation, log in at [Albion Free Market](https://albionfreemarket.com) and confirm that premium features (full flips, trade routes, calculators, etc.) are unlocked.

## KEEP YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ORGANIZED

- Manual purchases do **not** auto-renew. Set your own reminder before the time you bought expires.
- If you later switch to Stripe, you can manage or cancel from the [Manage Subscription](https://albionfreemarket.com/manage-subscription) page.
- All subscriptions remain non-refundable, even when purchased through AllShop, as stated on the support page.
