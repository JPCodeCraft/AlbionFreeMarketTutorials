# Albion Online: Best Mounts for PvP, PvE, and Gathering (2025)

![b9907d7385b04059f626f88150783f6dcf48a103](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b59f4229-2c9a-41e4-9718-dfc137d6969e)

Hey guys, in this article I will explain how in Albion Online, your mount isn’t just for getting from point A to B — it’s your escape plan, your chase advantage, and in some cases, your mobile tank. Let's say you're diving into Corrupted Dungeons, running high-risk gathering routes, or charging into ZvZ battles, choosing the right mount can make the difference between profit and pain. Here, I'll walk through the best mounts for PvP, PvE, and gathering — with real use cases. not just nerdy stats talk.

I’ve tried dozens of mounts across black zones, corrupted dungeons, faction wars, and gathering runs. Some were fast, some were fat, and a few made me wish I’d stayed in the city. So in this post, I want to share what actually works

## Best Mounts for PvP

PvP in Albion isn’t fair. If you're not faster or smarter, you're dead — and believe me your mount can ruin your day or save your day

### Specter Wolf – (My Go-To Solo PvP Mount right now)

I honestly don’t go into the black zone without a Specter Wolf anymore. This alpha wolf has actively saved me more times than I can count. It’s perfect for ganking, but also when a fight goes south and you need to ghost out before the zerg shows up.
Its active invisibility lets you ambush with surgical precision or vanish when a fight turns bad. Pair this with high mobility builds and you’re a ghost in the mist, hard to catch.
But it's quiet on the expensive side so if you aren't financially great you can choose other mounts.

### Armored Horse – (Balanced Pick)

Some people underestimate the Armored Horse — big mistake. It’s sturdy enough to survive focus fire and quick enough to reposition. In faction warfare or small-scale PvP, it keeps you moving without being a glass cannon.I used to ignore this one until I started doing faction PvP. The Armored Horse gives just enough tankiness and speed to rotate or retreat without being punished.

### Swiftclaw – Budget Ganker’s Best Friend

The Swiftclaw doesn’t look fancy, but it’s fast enough to chase and affordable enough to lose. It’s the go-to mount for budget gankers who dive red zones and don’t cry when things go wrong. Think of it as the PvP equivalent of a street fighter — lean, aggressive, and replaceable.Back when I was broke and still learning, Swiftclaw was my bread and butter. It's fast enough to chase, and if you lose it, no big deal. bring this when you know you might not come back alive.

## Best Mounts for PvE

Fame farming, dungeon diving, or exploring Mists? Your mount needs to balance speed, safety, and carry weight — PvE isn’t only about mobs, it’s about what comes after. If you farm solo like I do, you need something fast — but also something that lets you get away when a red dot appears on your minimap. PvE mounts need to strike a balance.

### Specter Wolf Again – Yes, It Works for PvE Too

![600px-SpecterWolfSkin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a589d57-8f42-41ce-ab83-5edeb0fdcd55)

I don’t use this only for PvP. If you're farming in red/black zones (you should) that invisibility is gold It can save your loot and time when a red-name squad rolls up mid-clear.. It lets me do content alone without stressing every time a blob appears near me.

### Boar – For Chill Static Farming

This underrated mount lets you fight mobs without dismounting, which means faster clears in low-danger zones and more consistency during long PvE grinds. Ideal for solo players running green dungeons or static zones with no PvP threat. I had no idea Boars let you fight while mounted until I watched some meme clip xD. Once I tried it, I started using it during longer static dungeon sessions where I didn’t want to dismount every five seconds. Doesn’t help with escape, though..

### T8 Horse – Zoom and Fame

Speed is life in PvE, and T8 horses get you in and out faster than most mounts. Especially valuable for players running solo random dungeons or farming faction mobs quickly across zones,Sometimes I just want speed — and Tier 8 horses give that. If you’re running solo random dungeons and rotating fast between zones, this mount pays for itself.

## The Only Mounts I Use When Gathering in Risky Zones

![205cc0aa8ca695bf2198b053e3143cf204980f30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c53e22f-4d6f-4f0e-bf56-7ff119ab41e8)

Gathering in Albion is always a gamble. You’re slow, loaded, and usually alone. The right mount is your only line of defense.

### Ox (T6–T8) – The Classic Load Tank

The Ox is the backbone of most gatherers. It’s not flashy, it’s not fast, but it’s a brick wall of carry weight. Perfect for solo players gathering stone, ore, or wood and just want to stack silver and dip. When I need pure carry weight, I stick to the Ox. It’s painfully slow, but you can bring back 5–10x more materials per run. I don’t risk it without a defensive set, though

### Giant Stag/Moose – When I Want to Play Safe but Still Gather Big

This is my default mount now. It has decent weight capacity and just enough speed to escape basic ganks. If you’re using invis pots or soldier armor builds, it’s actually pretty hard to catch. If you don’t want to be a turtle but still need to carry a lot, Giant Stag is the sweet spot. Enough weight for resource runs, fast enough to get away from average gankers — especially when paired with a soldier armor escape build.

### Transport Mammoth– Only When I Feel Lucky (or Suicidal)

This is not a gatherer’s mount. This is a logistics monster. Use it when you're hauling refined materials or loot from hideout to city — just make sure you're well-guarded, or you’ll feed 30 people at once.Okay, I’ve only used this a few times when doing hideout-to-city mega runs. It can carry ridiculous weight — but if you die, you feed half the map. Don’t do it without guards or a guild escort.

## I WOULD SAY

Every mount in Albion is a trade-off. Speed vs. safety. Carry weight vs. control. Expensive vs. replaceable. I’ve lost dozens of mounts to ganks, misclicks, and cocky overconfidence — but the ones I listed above? They’ve saved my hide more times than I can count.

Pick your mount based on how you play — not just what the meta says. Sometimes, the best mount isn’t the fastest… it’s the one you’re not afraid to lose.
