## Why gather them?

Gathering resources is a fundamental part of Albion Online’s player-driven economy. Whether you’re a solo player or part of a guild. Gathering offers a reliable way to earn silver or to craft your own gear.  
If you gather them yourself you reduce your reliance on the marketplace who sells items for high price most of the time and can profit by selling them yourself

## What to gather and where to gather?

You can gather any of the 5 resources in albion online as long as you have gathering tools to gather them. You should keep in mind that all biomes have their own resources.

If you are in forest biome you can gather – wood, stone and hide.

You can also see rate of enchanted resources in map by pressing ‘M’ and selecting zone.  
These Enchanted resources in Albion Online are special raw materials that you can collect occasionally in any zones. They can enhance weapon and armor, providing a significant boost in item power.

## Best resource to gather right now

Most of the time **hide** will be the best resource to gather since you have to first kill the mob and then skin it so it is time consuming but it will always give the highest profit (you can also fame up your weapon with this but by very little).  
But if you are in mountain biome you cannot gather this resource so either you have to choose other resources or have to change your biome.

If you want to gather hide you should go for **steppe biome with Bridgewatch** as main city

## Gathering equipment and consumables

Gathering equipment in Albion Online is specifically designed to enhance your efficiency while collecting resources. Each resource type has its own specialized gear set that increases gathering yield, reduces gathering time, and offers defensive skills to escape danger — especially in PvP zones. Whether you’re a casual gatherer or a hardcore resource hunter, having the right equipment makes a huge difference.

Consumables on the other hand help a lot when gathering in Albion Online. The most popular one is the **pork pie**, which gives you more gathering yield and lets you carry more. Some players also use **healing or invisibility potions** to stay safe in dangerous zones. Using the right food and potions can make gathering faster and safer.

## Which Gathering Mount Should You Choose?

Choosing the right mount for gathering depends on your budget and the zone you're entering.

- If you're low on silver, a **Transport Ox** is a solid choice. It's affordable and offers high carrying capacity, making it ideal for safe zones.
- The lower your budget, the lower the tier you should go for to minimize losses.
- If you have more silver and plan to gather in risky zones like **red or black zones**, consider using a **Giant Stag** or **Spectral/Moose**. These mounts offer higher speed and the **Courier ability**, which lets you carry more without being slowed down.

This is especially useful if you get dismounted by gankers, as it gives you a better chance to escape while carrying heavy resources.

### Final Suggestion:

**Mastering the collection of all five resources** not only makes you a versatile player, but also allows you to be self-sufficient.

Whether you're supplying a guild or leveling your personal crafting, gathering remains a long-term, profitable activity in Albion Online.
