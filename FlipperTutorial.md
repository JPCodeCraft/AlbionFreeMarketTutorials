# ALBION FREE MARKET FLIPPER TUTORIAL

- This is a collection of tutorials for the [Black Market Flipper](https://albionfreemarket.com/flipper) in Albion Free Market.
  
## BASICS

### What exactly is a flip?

- The Black Market Flipper tool is used to find **single use**, **instant** flips.
- By single use, we mean that the flip can be used only once. This is not the place to look for daily transport trade routes.
- By instant, we mean that you buy an item from a sell order in a normal market and instantly sell the item to a buy order on the Black Market.
  
### Where's the price data coming from?

- The price data is provided by [The Albion Online Data Project](https://www.albion-online-data.com/).
- To get your data uploaded, make sure to use the client that can be downloaded at their webpage.
- Alternatively, you can also use the [Albion Free Market Data Client](https://github.com/JPCodeCraft/AlbionDataAvalonia/releases). This project is an alternative to the oficial AODP client and provides basically the same functionality, but has a graphical interface that might make it easier to use.
- Both clients works by *sniffing* network traffic and collecting market data. If you feel unsecure by this, you can check the source code and realize that no private data is uploaded anywhere.

#### Is this allowed?
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> *Our position is quite simple. As long as you just look and analyze we are ok with it. The moment you modify or manipulate something or somehow interfere with our services we will react (e.g. perma-ban, take legal action, whatever)*.

### Where should I flip from?

- Albion Free Market's system finds flips from anywhere prices are uploaded.
- The most obvious flip consists of buying an item in **Caerleon** and selling it to the **Black Market**. This is the safest form of flipping, as it does not involve transporting through red zones. It's also the most disputed form of flipping, so expect lower profits. From Caerleon, 100k profit flips are common, 500k profit flips are uncommon, 1M+ profit flips are rare.
- You can also buy the items in the **royal cities** and transport them to the **Black Market**. This ads an extra layer of risk, as you can get ganked while crossing the red zones. You can expect higher profits and a bigger poll of flips to choose from when flipping like this. **Brecillien** is the most profitable city, but also the most dangerous one to flip from.

## UPGRADE FLIPS

### Basics

- An upgrade flip is when you buy a lower enchantment item (for example, a 7.0 item) and upgrade it using runes, souls and relics until it matches a buy order in the Black Market (for example, a 7.3 item).
- This means that you must buy the base item, buy (or have in stock) the upgrade items (runes, souls or relics), upgrade the item in the city and then sell it to the Black Market.
- Upgrade flips add a new layer of complexity, because you have to manage runes stocks, but also increase the amount of available flips and their potential profit, specially if you manage to buy your runes at good prices.

### Upgrade Items Prices

- When you save your Flipper Configuration, the prices you have on screen for the Upgrade Items are also saved. That means you can load them up at a later time. This is usefull for when you have a large stock of runes and will reuse the same prices for multiple flipping sessions.
