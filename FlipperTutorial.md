# ALBION FREE MARKET FLIPPER TUTORIAL

- This is a collection of tutorials for the [Black Market Flipper](https://albionfreemarket.com/flipper) in Albion Free Market.

## UPGRADE FLIPS

### Upgrade Items Prices
- When you save your Flipper Configuration, the prices you have on screen for the Upgrade Items are also saved. That means you can load them up at a later time. This is usefull for when you have a large stock of runes and will reuse the same prices for multiple flipping sessions.
