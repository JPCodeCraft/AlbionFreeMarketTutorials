# Albion Online Solo Weapons Analysis - Europe Server

In this article we'll analyze the current meta weapons for solo PVP in Albion Online **Europe server**.

For that we're using [Albion Free Market's](www.albionfreemarket.com) Meta Items tool for this analysis. This **free to use** tool constantly retrieves information about kill events in Albion Online directly from SBI's API. The data consists of the last 7 days and is updated continuously.

For the European server, hourly analyzed data spikes up to over 8 thousand kill events, as shown below. The spikes occur between 18:00 and 20:00 UTC.

## Filtering the Data

To filter the data, we're setting the _Slot Type_ to _Main Hand_ and _Fight Size_ to _Solo Attacker_. This allows us to limit the analyzed data to these specific constraints.

## Most Popular Solo PVP Weapons

To determine the most popular solo PVP weapon, we're sorting the data by _Total Player Count_. This represents the number of players observed in PVP events that match the filter settings.

Adept's Dual Swords [4.1] is the most popular solo PVP weapon, despite holding a low KDR of 0.7.

## Best Kill Death Ratio Solo PVP Weapons

When sorting by Kill Death Ratio, it's natural that very high-level weapons stand at the top of the charts. This data should be interpreted cautiously, as the low usage of these weapons can highlight extremes in the values, especially for KDR.

All top 10 KDR solo PVP weapons are level 4 enchanted. Grandmaster's Bloodletter [7.4] stands as king, having registered 446 kills and only 1 death.

To obtain more useful data, we can filter it to gear that was seen in PVP at least 2,000 times last week. This approach provides results that are more applicable to the average player.

With this filter applied, Expert's Double Bladed Staff [5.4] emerges as the Top 1 KDR popular solo PVP weapon, having registered 2,400 kills and only 41 deaths.

## Best Solo PVP Weapons to Kill High-Tier Players

If we set the tool to sort by _Average Kill Fame_, we can identify which weapons were used to kill players with higher-value gear.

Grandmaster's Prowling Staff [7.3] stands at the top with 1.4M average kill fame. It's worth noting that these weapons were used only a few times, which is why we should also analyze the popular (2,000 or more uses) weapons' average kill fame.

In this scenario, Expert's Bloodletter [5.4] leads with an average kill fame of 130k.

## Best Solo PVP Cheap Weapons

Lastly, we're examining the best KDR 4.1 weapons for solo PVP that were used at least 2,000 times last week. These are very affordable weapons that any new player can equip, typically selling for around 20k silver.

Adept's Wildfire Staff [4.1] has the best KDR at 0.8. While this is still relatively low, it might be acceptable given the low stakes involved. Further analysis shows that the average kill fame is 15.8k, while the average death fame is only 7.5k, indicating that it's a worthwhile choice.

## Conclusion

This analysis of solo PVP weapons in Albion Online's Europe server reveals several interesting trends:

1. **Popularity doesn't always equal effectiveness:** The most popular weapon, Adept's Dual Swords [4.1], has a relatively low KDR of 0.7, suggesting that popularity may be influenced by factors other than pure combat effectiveness.

2. **High-tier weapons dominate in KDR:** The top KDR weapons are all high-tier (6.4 and above), demonstrating the power of advanced gear. However, these are also less frequently used due to their cost and risk.

3. **Balanced performance in mid-tier weapons:** When looking at more commonly used weapons (2,000+ uses), we see Expert's Double Bladed Staff [5.4] leading by a wide margin in KDR, indicating a good balance of performance and accessibility (selling under 2M silver), followed by Expert's Bloodletter [5.4] (selling under 1.5M silver). 

4. **Specialized weapons for high-value targets:** Weapons like Grandmaster's Prowling Staff [7.3] excel at taking down high-value targets, as shown by their high average kill fame.

5. **Viable options for new players:** Even at the 4.1 tier, weapons like Adept's Wildfire Staff offer a positive kill/death fame ratio, making them good choices for newer players or those on a budget.

Remember that the meta is constantly evolving, and what works best can vary based on individual skill, playstyle, and the current state of the game. Use this information as a guide, but don't be afraid to experiment and find what works best for you in the dynamic world of Albion Online PVP.
