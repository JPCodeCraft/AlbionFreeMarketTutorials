# Albion Online Solo Weapons Analysis - Europe Server
In this article we'll analyze the current meta weapons for solo PVP in Albion Online **Europe server**.

For that we're using [Albion Free Market's](www.albionfreemarket.com) Meta Items tool. This tool constantly grabs information about kill events in Albion Online, directly from SBI's API. The data consists of the last 7 days and is updated constantly.

For the European server, hourly analyzed data spikes up to over 8 thousand kill events, as shown below.

## Filtering the data

To filter the data, we're setting the Slot Type to _Main Hand_ and Fight Size to _Solo Attacker_. This way, we can limit the analyzed data to those constraints.

## Most popular solo PVP weapons

To check the most popular solo PVP weapon, we're sorting the data by _Total Player Count_. This represents the amount of players that were seen in events that match the filter settings.

Adept's Dual Swords [4.1] is the most popular solo PVP weapon, even though it holds a low KDR of 0.7.

## Best Kill Death Ratio solo PVP weapons

When we sort by Kill Death Ratio, it's natural that very high level weapons stand at the top of the charts. This data must be taken with a grain of salt, since the fact that the weapons are not very used can highlight extremes in the values, specially for KDR.

All top 10 KDR solo PVP weapons are level 4 enchanted. Grandmaster's Bloodletter [7.4] stands king, having registered 446 kills and only 1 death.

To get more useful data, we can filter it to gear that was seen in PVP last week at least 2,000 times. That way we can get results that are more usable by the average player.

Like this, Expert's Double Bladed Staff [5.4] is the Top 1 KDR popular solo PVP weapon, having registered 2,400 kills and only 41 deaths.

## Best solo PVP weapons to kill high tier players

If we set the tool to sort by _Average Kill Fame_, we can see which weapons were used to kill players with higher value gear.

Grandmaster's Prowling Staff [7.3] stands at the top with 1.4M average kill fame. It must be noted that these weapons were used only a few times, which is why we should also analyze the popular (2,000 or more uses) weapons average kill fame.

In this scenario Expert's Bloodletter [5.4] is king with an average kill fame of 130k.

## Best solo PVP cheap weapons

Last, but not least, we're checking the best KDR 4.1 weapons for solo PVP that were used at least 2,000 times last week. These are very cheap weapon that any new player can afford, usually selling around 20k silver.

Adept's Wildfire Staff [4.1] has the best KDR, at 0.8. That's still pretty low, but might be acceptable since the stakes are so low. Further analysis show that the average kill fame is 15.8k, while the average death fame is only 7.5k, showing that it's worth it.
