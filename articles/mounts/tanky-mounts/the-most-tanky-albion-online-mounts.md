# The Best Tanky Albion Online Mounts

If your goal is to stay mounted under pressure, you want raw HP and strong resist stats. This list ranks mounts by a simple tankiness score.

## How the tankiness score works

Score formula:

`Tankiness Score = (HP * 0.60) + ((Armor + Magic Res + CC Res) * 0.40)`

Notes:
- This ranking only includes mounts where **HP**, **Armor**, **Magic Res**, and **CC Res** are present in the data.
- Higher score means the mount is harder to dismount and generally survives longer while you try to escape.

## Gear also matters

Your mount’s HP decides how long you stay mounted. While you are mounted, your **Armor**, **Magic Res**, and **CC Res** are added on top of the mount’s stats, so tanky gear really does help you stay on the mount longer.

Once you get forced off the mount, the mount’s stats stop helping and your gear takes over.

Think of it like a simple sum:
- **Mounted tankiness:** the mount’s HP + (mount Armor, Magic Res, CC Res + your Armor, Magic Res, CC Res).
- **On-foot tankiness:** your gear’s defenses plus your defensives, heals, and shields.

IMPORTANT: If your mount carry capacity is not a passive, once you dismount you lose that effect, so you might be stuck and unable to move. If the mount carry capacity is a passive, you retain it even when dismounted, so you can use escape gear (mobility + invisibility) to escape a gank.

If you want to feel harder to kill during transport runs, do not only buy a tanky mount. Wear tanky gear too, and if you get dismounted, use a shield or defensive cooldown right away so you can survive long enough to create space or remount.

## How to use this in real gameplay

- These mounts are mostly battle mounts. They are built to take hits, but they are expensive and slow.
- If you are doing transport, tankiness helps, but speed still matters. A tanky mount that cannot move is easy to surround.
- If you are in lethal zones, treat your mount as part of your gear set. Do not bring a mount you cannot replace.
