# The Fastest Albion Online Mounts

If you care about pure travel time, mount choice matters more than most people think. Some mounts have a high normal Speed, others are all about Gallop Speed, and a few can still move fast while carrying a lot of weight.

## Speed vs Gallop Speed (quick explanation)

- **Speed %** is your normal mounted movement speed.
- **Gallop %** is the speed you get after you have not taken damage for a short time while riding.
- **Gallop Time** is how long it takes to reach gallop speed.

In real gameplay, gallop is what makes long road travel feel fast, but it gets broken the moment you take a hit.

## Fastest Tank Mounts (Armor over 250)

## Practical tips

- If you are riding through zones where you might get poked a lot, **high Speed** matters because you will lose gallop often.
- If you are doing long safe roads, **high Gallop** usually wins.
- Watch out for mounts with negative carry stats (like the Owls). They are fast, but they are not made for hauling.
- If you are transporting, it is not just about load. A mount like the **Avalonian Basilisk** stays fast while still giving real carry weight.
